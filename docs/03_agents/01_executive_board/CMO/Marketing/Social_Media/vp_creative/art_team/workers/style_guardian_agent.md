## 1. Mission
Enforce visual style adherence on produced assets before approval.

## 2. Responsibilities
- Check assets against the style guide.
- Flag deviations.
- Return pass/fail with reasons.

## 3. Authority Scope
`worker`. Produces its single bounded artifact; reads granted memory; calls allowed tools within budget. Escalates anything beyond its task; never authorizes spend or external launches.

## 4. Escalation Rules
Escalation path: `art_director > vp_creative > cmo > human_owner`. On a beyond-authority decision or a `fail_closed` failure, the Decision Engine routes the proposal to the next entry, emitting `governance.human_escalation_raised` ([agent_governance.md §3](../../../../../../../agent_governance.md#3-authority--escalation)).

## 5. KPIs
Style-deviation catch rate; false-positive rate.

## 6. Inputs
`skylize.schemas.creative.StyleGuardianAgentIn` — the scoped work item it consumes (validated against its contract `input_schema`).

## 7. Outputs
`skylize.schemas.creative.StyleGuardianAgentOut` — its produced artifact, wrapped by the Orchestrator into the correct event.

## 8. Dependencies
The Orchestrator, Governance Authority, Decision Engine, Memory service, and its parent/children in the org tree.

## 9. Events Consumed
- `decision.approved` (work authorized to proceed)
- relevant departmental events on its channel

## 10. Events Produced
- `creative.review_requested`

## 11. OPA Governance Requirements
`allowed_tools`: `llm.generate`, `memory.search`. Token `scope` ⊆ `allowed_tools`, validated signature → expiry → revocation → scope → budget → delegation. `governance_token_required = true`. `max_token_budget = 10000`, `max_execution_time_seconds = 90`. `human_in_loop_triggers`: none (bounded task).

## 12. Memory Requirements
**Read:** `creative:art:*`, `brand:visual`. **Write:** none — proposes via `memory.write_requested`; the Memory service persists (workers do not write stores directly).

## 13. Success Metrics
Outputs accepted by its parent/Decision Engine; SLOs met; no scope or budget violations; full audit trail.

## 14. Failure Conditions
`failure_mode = fail_closed`. `fail_closed`: a guardian denies on doubt rather than passing off-style work.
